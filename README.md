# REST Assured Basic Project

This is a simple project using REST Assured to test the CRUD endpoints of an API. In order to simplify things, all tests
are run against the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/).

## What is REST Assured?

In summary, REST Assured is a group of **Java** libraries which enables us to **automate** REST API testing.

It has a friendly syntax that ease the development of automated tests in the Java programming language.

## How does it work?

Well, I'd be reinventing the wheel if I explained it here (not to mention that this is my first project using it). So,
if you want more info, I recommend you dive deep into the official [Documentation](https://rest-assured.io/).

I also recommend you search some courses about it. This basic project was made based on the
course [REST Assured Java Framework | Step by Step for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-assured-java-framework-step-by-step-for-beginners/)
.

## How to run the project

To run this project after cloning it, simply type `mvn test` in your shell (naturally, you need to
have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed and configured).

If you are running it through an IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can run the tests easily by the IDE's
interface.

I hope you learned something new! Thanks!
